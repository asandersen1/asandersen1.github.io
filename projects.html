  <h4>Estimating Pitcher Wins and Quantifying Pitcher Luck using Multinomial Logistic Regression</h4>
  <p>Detailed below is the writeup for a project I did where I attempted to estimate MLB pitcher wins using multinomial logistic regression in R. I was motivated by considerations about pitchers being "lucky" or "unlucky" in regards to wins and losses (particularly Jacob deGrom, whose career win total below 100 (as of writing this) is far below expectations).I tried to use ths estimate to give a metric for how "lucky" different pitchers were in MLB by comparing how many wins this regression expected them to have to how many wins they actually had. More details are in the writeup. For more infomation about logistic regression, the <i>Applied Logstic Regression</i> by Hosmer and Lemeshow. The writeup below assumes familiarity with baseball statistcs. For the intersted reader whose knowledge in this area is lacking but who wants to learn more, there are many resources for this. One such (tersely written) introduction is availible at <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Baseball_statistics">baseball-reference.com</a>. For the reader more knowledgable about baseball who wants to read about the criticisms of the pitcher win-loss statistc that inspired this project, there are again many references for this, but one such is an article by Minnesota Twins writer John Foley of <a href = "https://www.twinkietown.com/2020/5/19/21260897/twinkietown-analytics-fundamentals-come-learn-baseball-with-john-sabermetrics-myths-pitcher-wins-era">twinkietown.com</a>.</p>
