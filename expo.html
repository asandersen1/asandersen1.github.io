  <h2>Expositional Notes</h2>
  <p>I my own personal notes, I'll sometimes write in an expositional style when reviewing some familiar topics as a way of assessing my own understanding. I'll transcribe some of these handwritten notes to post here, then, with the hope that it may help someone else out. If anyone happens to read any of them and has any corrections, comments, or suggestions, please let me know!</p>
