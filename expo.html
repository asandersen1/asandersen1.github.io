<h1>Aidan Andersen's Personal Webpage</h1>
<p>This page is under construction! I'll use this part of my website to host some notes on whatever topics I'm interested in and hope anyone who stumbles upon it can learn something from it. Probably math stuff, mostly, but miscellaneous notes might be uploaded here as well. I'll be flexible with this. Send me an email if you read any of these and have a comment or suggestion!</p>
